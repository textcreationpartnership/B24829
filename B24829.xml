            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS several persons of wicked and restless Spirits have industriously gone about to spread false News, and to promote malicious Slanders and Calumnies, with an intention to raise Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion amongst His Majesties Good and Loyal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom. And whereas We the Lord Deputy and Councel, in order to suppress these unlawful and malicious practices, have by a late Proclamation forewarned, and strictly Commanded all His Majesties Subjects, that they should not presume by writing or speaking to utter or publish any such false News or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, thereby declaring that such as should offend therein, should be Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the utmost Rigour of the Law. And though We have caused the said Proclamation to be published in all the parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and so might have justly Expected a full Compliance thereunto from all His Majesties Subjects, yet such is the perverse humour and continuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of some restless spirits, that in contempt of Our said Proclamation, and of the known Laws of this Realm, they make it their constant practice by Writing and Speaking, to Publish and spread False News and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and their Iniquity have so far prevailed upon them, that they have raised a most scandalous, impious, and false Calumnie and Report, as if his Majesty's Protestant Subjects here were to be Massacred by His Majesties
<pb facs="tcp:186619:2"/> Roman Catholick Subjects of this Kingdom; Which Report was so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously improved, as that not only an Account thereof was sent into <hi>England</hi> and several there perswaded that a Massacre was actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here upon many of His Majesties Protestant Subjects; but that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons in this City, either out of fear and apprehension, or out of some evil Design to disturb the Peace, have met and assembled together at an unseasonable time of the night, in a riotous and warlike manner, to the great Terror of His Majesties people; and of the other hand, several other persons endowed with the same spirit, have maliciously and scandalously given out, as if His Majesties Roman-Catholick Subjects here were to be killed and massacred by his Majesties Protestant Subjects of this Realm. All which Contrivances are set on foot in this time of Invasion by Factious and Rebellious Spirits, with an intention to prejudice His Majesty's Affairs by raising and fomenting Animosities between His Majesties People.</p>
            <p>We the Lord Deputy and Councel in order to obviate the intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of such malitious Contrivances and unjust practices do hereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Earnestly to all his Majesties Subjects of this Kingdom, of what perswasion soever they be in point of Religion, to rest assured of his Majesties Protection without the least appr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
